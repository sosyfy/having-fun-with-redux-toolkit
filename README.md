Redux Toolkit is a package that simplifies the setup and configuration of a Redux store in a React application. It includes several features that make it easier to work with Redux, such as:

A configurable, pre-built store with sensible defaults
Automatic handling of the redux-thunk middleware for async actions
A createAsyncThunk utility for creating async actions
A createSlice utility for creating and managing reducers
